# Introduction

This document is available online at [https://web-token.spomky-labs.com](https://web-token.spomky-labs.com).

## JWT Framework

This framework provides an implementation of:

* JW**S** [JSON Web Signature \(RFC 7515\)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515),
* JW**T** [JSON Web Token \(RFC 7519\)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519),
* JW**E** [JSON Web Encryption \(RFC 7516\)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516),
* JW**A** [JSON Web Algorithms \(RFC 7518\)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518).
* JW**K** [JSON Web Key \(RFC 7517\)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).
* JSON Web Key Thumbprint \([RFC 7638](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7638)\).
* Unencoded Payload Option [RFC7797](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7797).

This framework is not just a library, it also contains a Symfony bundle for easy integration into your application. It also provides a standalone console command that will help you to manage your keys and key sets.

## Provided Features

### Supported Input Types:

JWS or JWE objects support every input that can be encoded into JSON:

* `string`, `array`, `integer`, `float`...
* Objects that implement the `\JsonSerializable` interface such as `JWK` or `JWKSet`

The [detached payload](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#appendix-F) is supported.

### Supported Serialization Modes

* Compact JSON Serialization Syntax for JWS and JWE
* Flattened JSON Serialization Syntax for JWS and JWE
* General JSON Serialization Syntax for JWS and JWE

### Supported Compression Methods

| Compression Method | Supported | Comment |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| Deflate \(`DEF`\) | YES |  |
| GZip \(`GZ`\) | YES | _This compression method is not described in the specification_ |
| ZLib \(`ZLIB`\) | YES | _This compression method is not described in the specification_ |

### Supported Key Types \(JWK\)

| Key Type | Supported | Comment |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| oct | YES | Symmetric keys |
| RSA | YES | RSA based asymmetric keys |

| OKP | YES | Octet Key Pair based asymmetric keys |

JWK objects support JSON Web Key Thumbprint \([RFC 7638](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7638)\).

_Note: we use a_ `none` _key type for the_ `none` _algorithm only._

### Key Sets \(JWKSet\)

JWKSet is fully supported.

## Prerequisites

This framework needs at least:

* ![PHP 7.1+](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-7.1%2B-ff69b4.svg),
* GMP extension.
* MBString extension.

Depending on the algorithms you using, other PHP extensions may be required \(e.g. OpenSSL\).

Please also consider the following optional requirements:

* If you intent to use `EdDSA` or `ECDH-ES` algorithm with `Ed25519`/`X25519` curves on PHP 7.1, please install this [third party extension](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium-php)

## Continuous Integration

It has been successfully tested using `PHP 7.1`, `PHP 7.2` and `nightly` with all algorithms.

Tests vectors from the [RFC 7520](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7520) are fully implemented and all tests pass. Other test vector sources may be used \(e.g. new algorithm specifications\).

We also track bugs and code quality using [Scrutinizer-CI](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/web-token/jwt-framework) and [Sensio Insight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/b7efa68f-8962-41cf-a2e3-4444426bc95a).

Coding Standards are verified by [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/105997386).

Code coverage is analyzed by [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/github/web-token/jwt-framework).
